# cone-knowledge-graph

Cone-KG is a semantic knowledge graph comprising of over 4 million Covid-19 news articles extracted originally from social media and news portals on the web. The knowledge graph is developed based on the Fandet ontology model. It has been developed primarily as a means of leveraging semantic technologies towards knowledge acquisition and discovery in relation to the Covid-19 health crisis. Furthermore, it constitutes a central portal for novel research and data mining based on the semantic nature of the data, which facilitates automated data linkage and integration from diverse heterogenous sources.

The knowledge graph files can be downloaded from the following URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ox5gveggSdZnNNzv73BosSGxJ8H0VLmt?usp=sharing
